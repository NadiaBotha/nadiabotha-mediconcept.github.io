        <p>Diabetes is a chronic medical condition in which sugar, or glucose, levels build up in your bloodstream. The hormone insulin helps move the glucose from your blood into your cells, where it’s used for energy.</p>
        <p>In type 2 diabetes, your body’s cells aren’t able to respond to insulin as well as they should. In later stages of the disease, your body may also not produce enough insulin.</p>
        <p>Uncontrolled type 2 diabetes can lead to chronically high blood glucose levels, causing several symptoms and potentially leading to serious complications.</p>
        <h3>Symptoms of type 2 diabetes</h3>
        <p>In type 2 diabetes, your body isn’t able to effectively use insulin to bring glucose into your cells. This causes your body to rely on alternative energy sources in your tissues, muscles, and organs. This is a chain reaction that can cause a variety of symptoms.</p>
        <p>Type 2 diabetes can develop slowly. The symptoms may be mild and easy to dismiss at first. The early symptoms may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>constant hunger</li>
            <li>a lack of energy</li>
            <li>fatigue</li>
            <li>weight loss</li>
            <li>excessive thirst</li>
            <li>frequent urination</li>
            <li>dry mouth</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Threatment for type 2 diabetes</h3>
        <p>You can effectively manage type 2 diabetes. Your doctor will tell you how often you should check your blood glucose levels. The goal is to stay within a specific range.</p>
        <p>Follow these tips to manage type 2 diabetes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Include foods rich in fiber and healthy carbohydrates in your diet. Eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will help keep your blood glucose levels steady.</li>
            <li>Eat at regular intervals</li>
            <li>Only eat until you’re full.</li>
            <li>Control your weight and keep your heart healthy. That means keeping refined carbohydrates, sweets, and animal fats to a minimum.</li>
            <li>Get about half an hour of aerobic activity daily to help keep your heart healthy. Exercise helps to control blood glucose, too.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your doctor will explain how to recognize the early symptoms of blood sugar that’s too high or too low and what to do in each situation. They’ll also help you learn which foods are healthy and which foods aren’t.</p>
        <p>Not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs to use insulin. If you do, it’s because your pancreas isn’t making enough insulin on its own. It’s crucial that you take insulin as directed. There are other prescription medications that may help as well.</p>
