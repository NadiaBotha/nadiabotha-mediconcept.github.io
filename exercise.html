        <p>How many times have you joined a gym or committed to an exercise plan to lose weight, only to back out after a few weeks because you have no idea how often you should work out?</p>
        <p>If your answer is “too many to count,” you’re not alone. Knowing how many days you should exercise can be confusing. This is especially so if the amount of time you’re putting in doesn’t match up with your goals.</p>
        <p>So, whether your goal is to sweat it out on the treadmill more often to lose a few pounds or to increase the amount of weight you’re lifting in order to gain muscle, the following tips can help you hit your target sooner and with greater success.</p>
        <h3>How often should you work out for weight loss?</h3>
        <p>Knowing how often you should strength train and do cardiovascular exercise to lose weight depends on how quickly you want to see results.</p>
        <p>The general recommendation is to lose no more than 1 to 2 pounds per weekTrusted Source. That said, many people seek programs that are designed for faster weight loss.</p>
        <p>In the simplest of terms, you’ll need to burn more calories than you take in to lose weight. Dieting has proven to be an effective method of losing weight, but in order to maintain weight loss, you need to exercise.</p>
        <p>How much weight you lose depends on the amount of exercise you’re willing to commit to and how closely you stick to your diet. If you really want to see results reflected on the scale and continue to make progress over time, you need to commit to working out at least four to five days per week.</p>
        <p>But remember, you’ll build up to this. To start, you might only want to do two or three days per week and slowly work your way up to five days. Plan your workouts to include a combination of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>cardio</li>
            <li>strength training</li>
            <li>core work</li>
            <li>stretching</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For maximum results, a workout program should consist of cardiovascular and strength training exercise. When you lift weights, you increase your lean muscle mass. This allows you to increase your metabolism and burn calories at a higher rate, even when you’re not working out.</p>
        <p>Cardiovascular exercise isn’t just essential in maintaining good heart health. Cardio exercise can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>burn calories</li>
            <li>boost your mood</li>
            <li>decrease stress</li>
        </ul>
